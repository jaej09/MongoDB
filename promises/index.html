      /* Promises
      Promise is a tool that we have for managing asynchronous code flow throughout our application.
      which means it is a tool for handling any code that is going to execute at some point in the future.
      it is almost same as setTimeout function. it executes code two seconds in the future.

      when we create a promise by using new Promise structure, we pass in a function.
      the function is called with the resolve and reject functions.
      the resolve and reject functions allow us to manipulate the state that a promise is in.

      3 states of Promises 
        1. unresolved - waiting for something to finish.
                        waiting for the user to finish up all their possible clicks of the game.
                        after those two seconds the promise enter either the resolved or rejected state wheen it promises results.
        2. resolved - something finished and it all went ok.
                      we consider to be resolved if the user successfully clicked on the button at least 6 times.
        3. rejected - something finished and something went bad.
                      we consider to be resolved if the user did not clicked on the button at least 6 times.
        
        the important thing to note here is that it is really up to us to decide what constitutes a resolve and a rejected Promise.
        the lecturer decided to say that if the user lost the game or something went wrong --> rejected.
        OR if use won --> resolved.

      function startGame() {
        let counter = 0;
        document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", () => {
          ++counter;
        });

        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          setTimeout(() => {
            if (counter > 5) resolve();
            else reject();
          }, 2000);
        });
      }

      startGame() // when startGame function is called, it returns the Promisee that was created.
        .then(() => alert("You win!"))
        .catch(() => alert("You lost!"));
